### endeavors

> "necessity is the mother of invention"

Since my graduation in August of last year, I've been simultaneously laying many paths for my own future. The first few months post-grad were spent strictly applying to jobs, but with only some minor successes in the form of professional network expansion, and a few interviews. While this may not have been the desired outcome, this "period of adversity" has pushed me to iteratively find avenues of self-improvement; e.g. grinding leetcode or building side projects. I've been fortunate to have found a sustainable line of work as a substitute teacher in the meantime, which I've found to be very forgiving and flexible. Mostly I "teach" (supervise and hand out papers) senior anatomy & physiology, and two classes of freshman biology. The surprise here is that I've actually really enjoyed teaching, and in another life–or system where high school teachers are better paid–I might have taken this up as my career. It's rewarding work, and it's a very direct way to #maketheworldabetterplace.
But it's not enough. I need more. 

This stretch of time has also pushed me to think further out of the box, that is, beyond just seeking full-time employment. Thanks to a flexible internship (shoutout my ceo) and VC twitter, I'd been exposed to a bit of "founders mindset", which had me debating starting my own thing. Those who have known me for a while have certainly heard me ramble about "project d(ai)abetes" or some other version of a medical product or algorithm that helps people living with type 1 diabetes live healthier lives. At first I got gung-ho about it and thought maybe I could start my own medical device company until I came down to earth when I realized how much the testing and manufacturing equipment would cost. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography machines don't come cheap. 

Then I reconciled and thought about starting a research non-profit with open source foundations, which is what lead me to build this website. We'll see how that goes, perhaps I can capture enough interest for people with t1d to donate their data for research, or maybe the language model I've been building a dataset for will be of good use to my fellow diabetics. But I made the realization that getting grant funding for something so ambitious as a person with only a B.S. in CompSci was a bit far-fetched.

All of these hypothetical endeavors came to remind me of what I had dreamt of many years ago, the epiphany of purpose I had in my integral calculus class, and the core of what drives me. *I want to do research that makes a difference.* I'd been avoiding the idea because of my age and concerns about getting my life started, but I've recently come around to the fact that pursuing further schooling and academia might be the best chance to do the research I want. So last weekend, rather than trying to relax on Friday night, I started drafting a... thesis? thesis proposal? Basically I started putting my ideas down, consolidating my scattered notes. Once I have a decent enough draft, I'll take it to some of my previous academic and research influences, to see if I could garner their support. I'll reignite some connections at the Stanford Diabetes Research Center, the institution that I would love to work with more than anything else. This could be the beginning of the legacy I want to build, leveraging principles of big data, machine learning methods, and 16 years of lived experience with diabetes. Letting this intersection of knowledge go to waste is something I would only regret in the long run.

I've found myself ruminating on multi-head attention, contextualized embeddings, and all of the connecting factors of t1d that could be hiding in multi-dimensional matrices. There has to be something we've missed.

So come this fall, I'll be applying to graduate school. Maybe I'll get to be *Dr. Jones* one day after all.
